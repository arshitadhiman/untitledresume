  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <p>
    A student pursuing a degree in Biological Sciences with minors in Data Science and engaged in Quick Commerce endeavors, I possess a deep-seated interest in mental health research, particularly in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD).  Driven by a desire to explore and advance knowledge in this field, I aim to utilize my academic background and entrepreneurial pursuits to make a intersection of biology, data science, mental health and entrepreneurship.
